# SimpleNote
This is a basic note taking app that utilizes firebase to offer realtime data-sync and easy authentication. I decided to create this application as a learning exercise after completing [this free udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) by google.
